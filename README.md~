# pAGDT
A PDT2.0-compatible version of Perseus' Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank

# How to use it

If you want to browse the trees using [TrEd](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred/), just make sure to copy the schemas files in a folder where the software can find them (bottom line, put them in the same directory as the data). At the moment, I am just using the standard PDT schemas, so you might already have them installed in your computer, for example if you have downloaded the PDT2.0 extension for TrEd.

# πAGDT or pAGDT?
πAGDT is the official brand. I prefer π (it's more evocative, don't you think?). But GitHub didn't like the non-asci character in the repository's name, so I guess I'll have to live with both versions...

# Why πAGDT by the way?
Π (or one should say "P") stands for "PDT-compatible" or for "Prague" (as in Prague Dependency Treebank) if you prefer. The Greek letter is used because... well, can you guess why?
