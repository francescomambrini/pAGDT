# Script folder

## Intorduction
This folder contains a bunch of useful scripts, scenarios, or a simple list of commands that can be copy-pasted to the command line to deal with the Ï€AGDT files in Treex.

For Treex scenarios see [the Treex Scenario tutorial](http://search.cpan.org/~varisd/Treex-Doc-2.20150928/lib/Treex/Tutorial/Scen.pod)
